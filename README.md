# Open Source For Common Good
A curated list of open source projects that serve a social or environmental goal.

Some projects out there didn't make the list, because while being cool, didn't have any history of pull-requests and few or no collaborators.  Right now, I'm only including projects that have had some activity in the past year.  I might start a second list for projects that look promising, but have gone quiet and could use a revival.
